## General Information
BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has experienced significant revenue declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To recover post-lockdown, they aim to understand the factors influencing demand for shared bikes. This will help them prepare for market recovery and stay competitive.

The company has collected data on daily bike demand and relevant factors, such as meteorological conditions and customer behavior, to gain insights into:

Significant variables affecting bike demand.
How well these variables predict demand.
Business Goal: You are tasked with modeling bike demand based on the available independent variables. The model will help BoomBikes optimize their strategy to meet future demand and guide management in understanding the dynamics of new markets.

## Conclusions
- Weather & Season has a high impact on the bike rentals. Bad weather causes the bike rentals to go down and good weather people tend to use the bike rentals.
